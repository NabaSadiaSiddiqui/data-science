**src** contains R code that generates graphs in png files and saves it under **plots** directory  
* helper.R contains helper functions which download data from the cloud and return it as a dataset  
* plot1.R contains code that generates plot1.png file  
* plot2.R contains code that generates plot2.png file  
* plot3.R contains code that generates plot3.png file  
* plot4.R contains code that generates plot4.png file  
* plot5.R contains code that generates plot5.png file  
* plot6.R contains code that generates plot6.png file  
**plots** hosts the png files that have been generated by running each of the four source code R files (plot1.R generated plot1.png)  
**data** contains the data downloaded from the cloud, and used to plot each of the image files by R source code
